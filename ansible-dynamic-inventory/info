Instead of a static inventory file, Ansible dynamically discovers all servers matching a specific tag,
name, or other criteria on any cloud using a plugin, and automatically groups them — this is dynamic 
inventory.

steps:

1. aws configure --> should be done

2. create yaml file like name.'aws_ec2.yaml' for better documentation not mandatory.

3. create demo.yaml file to run on all those servers

4. create ansible.cfg and include above .aws_ec2.yaml as inventory

5. Run --> "ansible-inventory --graph" to connect to aws and list all servers based on filters and 
   group them into group name given.(pip3.9 install boto3 botocore)

6. Run --> ansible-playbook demo.yaml -e "ansible_user=ec2-user" -e "ansible_password=DevOps321" 
   to install and run nginx on all servers grouped.
