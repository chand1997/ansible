    - name: execute ls using command
      ansible.builtin.command: ls -l > /tmp/output.txt
# ls -l > /tmp/output.txt --> this command lists files in long format and stores the result in output.txt
# but command can only access files but not more than that like piping, redirections(>,>>),etc
# in order to do that we have to use shell.
