I want to store the database password "ExpenseApp@1" in ansible-vault

steps:

1. ansible-vault create mysql_password
   this asks vault-password and then creates mysql_password file and enter like
    mysql_pass: ExpenseApp@1

    ansible-vault --help --> for various options

2. and add route for above file in vars_files in mysql playbook like
   vars_files:
    -  ~/mysql_password

3. if we run mysql playbook it gives error like no password for decryption,then
  we have to run playbook like
    ansible-playbook <mysql-playbook> --ask-vault-pass

    or 

  change ansible.cfg 
    ask_vault_pass = true

In above case the playbook stops to ask password, inorder to make it automatic
create file in server like vault_pass and give path in ansible.cfg
   vault_password_file = ~/vault_pass


So basically we are,
1. creating vault to store mysql_password which is encrypted file.
2. Inoredr to use mysql_password , it has to be decrypted
3. We are giving vault password to decrypt.
4. We have to maintain that vault password in our servers and give path of that location.
soo complicating, so just use parameter store in aws

steps:

1. go to parameter store on aws
2. create parameter for mysql_password itself like /expense/mysql/mysql_pass
3. use it like --> lookup('amazon.aws.aws_ssm', '/expense/mysql/mysql_pass', decrypt=true)
